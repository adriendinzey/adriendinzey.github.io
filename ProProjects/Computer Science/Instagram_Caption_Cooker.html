        <h1>Instagram Caption Cooker</h1>
        <h4>08/2022 â€” Present (Ongoing)</h4>
        <p>       
          This project is beiing built with the aim to create a web application such that users can upload a photo and the app will generate a caption for the photo that they could use on Instagram. 
          This is different from just creating tags or a description of the photo as the user is expecting something that sounds natural for what someone might usually find as a caption on Instagram. 
          The project involves creating convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural network for image recognition and natural language processing.

          This is a group effort between myself and <a href="https://abramkremer.github.io/">Abram Kremer</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abramkremer/">(LinkedIn)</a>.

          This project aims to use the following technologies:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Python
            </li>
            <li>
              Tensorflow
              <ul>
                <li>
                  For creating the actual neural networks required
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Keras
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Implementation of the neural networks
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Amazon Web Services
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The plan is to create a Flask app (which will created around the overall model) 
                  where users will be able to upload images and then the captions will be sent back to them. 
                  Behind the scenes, the application will take the uploaded data and make requests to the model to predict a caption.
                  All of this communication will be accomplished through REST API requests. 
                  Having no web development experience at the time of this writing, 
                  it's very possible the final product will end up with a different architecture than the one described here.
                  Ideally, once the simple Flask app is built out, 
                  we are aiming to expand it into a more legitimate web application by introducing other services such as 
                  Elastic Beanstalk to manage the application and an S3 bucket for data storage.
