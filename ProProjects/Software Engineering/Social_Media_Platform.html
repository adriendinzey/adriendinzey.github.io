        <h1>Buddy Banter</h1>
        <h4>04/2023 â€” Present</h4>
        <p>Buddy Banter is a social media platform, similar in concept to Facebook. 
          It allows users to make a profile, set a picture and bio for their page and make blog posts. 
          Other users can then comment on these posts, like posts/comments and add friends. 
          Similar to Facebook, each user has their own profile showing all their blog posts, as well as a main home feed of their friends' posts.

          This project was built with Ruby on Rails using the MVC architecture built into this framework. 
          Currently for the frontend it is basic HTML using Embedded Ruby (ERB), 
          however in the next iteration webpacker will be implemented to allow for React to be used.

          Currently the platform is fully functional and available to try out. Create your own profile, search for friends and start socializing!

          <h3>The live demo is available for use <a href="https://buddy-banter.onrender.com/">here</a>. <br><br>
             The source code is available <a href="https://gitlab.com/adriendinzey/social-media-platform">here</a>. <br><br> 
             <b>Note that this demo will likely take a minute or two to load, as the project goes offline after not being used for a certain period of time, 
             and so it needs to be started back up when first accessed.</b></h3>

          <br>
          <h2>FUTURE GOALS:</h2>
          <p>Aside from the aforementioned addition of React and added aesthetics, 
            I will be adding live chat (implementing web sockets), improving the layout for messaging and finding friends 
            and the ability to add media such as photos and gifs for posts/comments.
