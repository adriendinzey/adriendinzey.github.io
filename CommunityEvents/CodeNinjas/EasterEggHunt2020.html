        <h1>Code Ninjas Easter Egg Hunt 2020</h1>
        <p>As COVID-19 was beginning to set in on Winnipeg, Manitoba, Easter was fast approaching. 
          Our first lockdown had just hit and a lot of parents were concerned with how their children would be able to manage with the sudden changes.
          One of these changes was going from seeing their friends almost every day to not seeing them in person at all! 
          <br>
          <br>
          With that in mind, as a "Code Sensei" at Code Ninjas Winnipeg I and my colleague Abram Kremer were tasked with creating a "Virtual Easter Experience". 
          This led to the creation of a Roblox game where kids could play with their friends and find "Easter Eggs" hidden across the map! 
          While the game is no longer public, you can get more information in my interview with Global News Winnipeg on this event!
